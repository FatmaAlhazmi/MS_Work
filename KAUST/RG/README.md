# Riemannian Geometry

This course was entirely problem-based, with no formal lectures or notes. Instead, the instructor provided a problem set, and students were tasked with solving and presenting solutions in class.

Currently, I’ve uploaded the problem set provided by the instructor. You can find it here: [Problem Set](https://users.mccme.ru/mskopenkov/courses/skopenkov-geometry-22.pdf). I don’t have formal solutions at the moment, but I *might* share some in the future.

For a first course in geometry, my friend (an expert in differential geometry and currently pursuing a PhD in the field) recommended these two excellent resources:
1. [*Differential Geometry: A First Course in Curves and Surfaces* by Theodore Shifrin](https://github.com/FatmaAlhazmi/MS_Work/blob/main/KAUST/RG/A%20First%20Course%20in%20Curves%20and%20Surfaces%20.pdf)
2. *An Introduction to Manifolds* by Loring W. Tu (Second Edition)

This folder may grow over time as I revisit the material and create my own notes or solutions.
