# TikZ Figure Collection

This is a collection of **TikZ figures** that I made for physics. The goal is to provide ready-to-use and customizable figures for academic and personal projects.

---

## Features

- Each figure is written as a **standalone** `.tex` file.
- You can easily customize these figures by editing the `.tex` files.

## Figures

Here are some figures you can use. I will be adding more figs on a regular basis.

| Figure Name                             | Preview                                   | Description               |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `veff-main-curve.tex`                   | ![Veff Main Curve](path/to/figure1.png)  | Effective potential plot including \( V_\text{eff} \), \( 1/r^2 \), and \( -1/r \). |
| `bloch-sphere.tex`                      | ![Bloch Sphere](path/to/figure2.png)     | Bloch sphere depicting qubit states and angles \( \theta \), \( \phi \). |
| `surface-s-vector.tex`                  | ![Surface S Vector](path/to/figure3.png) | Surface \( S \) showing vectors \( \vb{r}, \vb{r}' \), and \( \vb{\tau} \). |
