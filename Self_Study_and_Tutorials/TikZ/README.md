# TikZ Figure Collection

This is a collection of **TikZ figures** that I made for physics. The goal is to provide ready-to-use and customizable figures for academic and personal projects.

## Features

- Each figure is written as a **standalone** `.tex` file.
- You can easily customize these figures by editing the `.tex` files.

---
## How to Use

1. Browse the table below and pick a figure.
2. Open the corresponding `.tex` file in your favorite LaTeX editor.
3. Customize it if needed:
   - Change labels, colors, or sizes to fit your project.
4. Compile the file to generate a PDF of the figure:
   ```bash
   pdflatex filename.tex
   ```

5.	Convert the PDF to PNG or SVG using your favorite tool:
	  •	For PNG:
    ```bash
    magick filename.pdf filename.png
    ```
   •	For PNG:
    ```bash
    pdf2svg filename.pdf filename.svg
    ```
