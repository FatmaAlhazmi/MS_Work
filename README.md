This repo is more like a personal diary for my academic journey, primarily intended for my own use. But I would be absolutely happy if others find it helpful as well. :)

My wonderful friend created a similar repo during her bachelor‚Äôs in CS, and I found the idea super inspiring ([check out her amazing repo!](https://github.com/siudro/Operating_Systems_Labs)). Since I also have a deep passion for documenting and organizing information, I decided to create one for my MS journey. Here, I aim to compile and structure all my notes, homework assignments (along with their solutions), tutorials of tools I frequently use (like Git), and anything else I learn along the way.

I created this repo basically to keep everything organized and to practice using tools like LaTeX (especially for diagrams) and Git; This semester, I started a new study method: I take rough notes during lectures and later rewrite them in LaTeX to understand and organize the material better. Collecting everything here seemed like a good idea, and maybe others might find it useful too. While I‚Äôve done my best to ensure these notes are accurate, they are personal and may include errors, typos, or oversights. If you spot anything or have ideas for improvement, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your feedback!
