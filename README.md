# Master's Journey Repository

This repo is more like a personal diary for my academic journey, primarily intended for my own use. But I would be absolutely happy if others find it helpful as well. :)

My wonderful friend created a similar repo during her bachelor‚Äôs in CS, and I found the idea super inspiring ([check out her amazing repo!](https://github.com/siudro/Operating_Systems_Labs)). Since I also have a deep passion for documenting and organizing information, I decided to create one for my MS journey. Here, I aim to compile and structure all my notes, homework assignments (along with their solutions), tools I frequently use (like Git), and anything else I learn along the way.

I first started doing Applied Mathematics at KAUST, which was quite a journey at the Advanced Algorithms and Numerical Analysis Lab. I have so so much love for this group and for KAUST. However, after A LOT of thinking, I decided to switch gears and go back to physics and so I joined the physics program at KFUPM.
