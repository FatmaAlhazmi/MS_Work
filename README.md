This repo is more like a personal diary for my academic journey, primarily intended for my own use. But I would be absolutely happy if others find it helpful as well. :)

My wonderful friend created a similar repo during her bachelor’s in CS, and I found the idea super inspiring ([check out her amazing repo!](https://github.com/siudro/Operating_Systems_Labs)). Since I also have a deep passion for documenting and organizing information, I decided to create one for my MS journey. Here, I aim to compile and structure all my notes, homework assignments (along with their solutions), tutorials of tools I frequently use (like Git), and anything else I learn along the way.

I first started doing Applied Mathematics at KAUST, which was quite a journey at the Advanced Algorithms and Numerical Analysis Lab. I have so so much love for this group and for KAUST. However, after A LOT of thinking, I decided to switch gears and go back to physics and so I joined the physics program at KFUPM.

## 📚 Self-Study

In addition to my personal studies, I enjoy creating educational programs for my little nephews and nieces to introduce them to STEM concepts. These programs are designed to be interactive and hands-on.

- [Scratch, Makey Makey, Microbit, Math Critical Thinking, and Robotics (Ages 8–9)](/MS_Work/Summer_plan2_kiddos.pdf)
- [Python, Arduino, and 3D Printing (Ages 12–14)](/MS_Work/Summer_plan_for_my_kiddos-2.pdf)
